## Setup for the above screenshots

VSCode Setup for Recursive Font:

- [Download font: Recursive Mono (v.1.084 or above)](http://recursive.design/)
- Unzip the downloaded file and install all fonts under the folder _Recursive_Code_
- Make changes in VSCode _settings.json_ as shown below (I'm using _Duotone_ variant): 
 ```
  "editor.fontLigatures": true,
  "editor.fontFamily": "Rec Mono Duotone",
  "scm.inputFontFamily": "Rec Mono Duotone",
  "debug.console.fontFamily": "Rec Mono Duotone",
  "editor.codeLensFontFamily": "Rec Mono Duotone",
  "editor.inlayHints.fontFamily": "Rec Mono Duotone",
 ```
- Have a visual treat!
